    "A smore https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%27more is a popular campfire treat consisting of marshmellows, chocolate bars, and graham crackers. \n",

    "- Each smore requires 1 graham cracker square. There are 32 squares in a box of graham crackers.\n",
    "- Each smore requires 1 section of chocolate. There are 24 sections of chocolate in package. \n",
    "\n",
    "So with 1 bag of marshmallows, 1 box of graham crackers, an 1 package of chocolate you can only make 24 smores (and you'll have 8 leftover crackers and 36 marshmallows).\n",
